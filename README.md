This generates musical sequences of stacked note embeddings which are then converted to midi files
Training data extracted from on gp5/midi files from songsterr.com
The model was trained to predict the temporal difference between notes too, but currently the rusults with this feature aren't satisfying, so the example sequences all use fixed times
